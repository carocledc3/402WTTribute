        <p><i>A tribute to <b>Ferdinand Edralin Marcos</b> (1917/9 - 1989/9), 10th president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, who died the richest man in the graveyard. </i></p>

        <p>Serving in the House and the Senate befre becoming president, his long 20-year presidency is marked by the ruin of the economy and the peso, overreliance on foreign debt, electoral fraud and the disregard of the Constitution, a nine-year period of martial law and the gross violation of human rights during it.</p>
        <p>As per the Presidential Commission on Good Government, he and his wife Imelda Marcos (somehow still alive today) are estimated to have stolen upwards of US$5 billion (PH₱ 293.9 billion) during his 20-year presidency, only part of which has been returned to the citizenry.</p>

        <p>We Filipinos of today remember his sour legacy by enjoying our right to freedom of speech, of expression, and the press, as well as the right to live under good governance, among other fundamental human rights that he fought so hard to suppress during the years of his presidency.</p>
